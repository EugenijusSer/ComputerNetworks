# ComputerNetworks

Program written in Java for Computer Networks module. It simulates package sending through a network of routers using routing tables where you can add your own routers, links and their weight.

There is also possibility to add or edit them during the simulation as package travels 15 seconds between the routers. The network will react accordingly and recalculate routing tables and find the fastest path using Djikstra algorithm.
